#### Abstract

We propose a performance analysis tool for learning-enabled systems that allows operators to uncover potential performance issues \emph{before} deploying DNNs in their systems. The tools that exist for this purpose require operators to faithfully model all components (a white-box approach) or do inefficient black-box local search. We propose a gray-box alternative, which eliminates the need to precisely model all the system's components. Our approach is faster and finds substantially worse scenarios compared to prior work. We show that a state-of-the-art learning-enabled traffic engineering pipeline can underperform the optimal by $6\times$ --- a much higher number compared to what the authors found.
