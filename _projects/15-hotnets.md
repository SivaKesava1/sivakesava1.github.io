#### Abstract

Many problems that cloud operators solve are computationally expensive, and operators often use heuristic algorithms (that are faster and scale better than optimal) to solve them more efficiently.
Heuristic analyzers enable operators to find when and by how much their heuristics underperform. However, these tools do not provide enough detail for operators to mitigate the heuristic's impact in practice: they only discover a _single input instance_ that causes the heuristic to underperform (and not the full set) and they do not _explain why_.

We propose $\mathcal{X}$Plain, a tool that extends these analyzers and helps operators understand when and why their heuristics underperform. 
We present promising initial results that show such an extension is viable.
