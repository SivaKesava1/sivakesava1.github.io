#### Abstract

=sc^Raha^sc=  is the first general tool that can analyze probable _degradation_ of traffic engineered networks under _arbitrary_ failures and traffic shifts to prevent outages. =sc^Raha^sc=  addresses a significant gap in prior work which consider only (1) $\le k$ failures; (2) specific traffic engineering schemes; and (3) the maximum impact of failures irrespective of the network design point.

Our insight is to formulate the problem in terms of heuristic analysis, where one seeks to maximize the performance _gap_ between the network design point (_i.e.,_ the network with no failures) and the network under failures. We invent techniques that allow us to exploit the mechanisms within these tools to encode the problem into components which can handle them. We present extensive experiments on Microsoft's production network and those of Topology Zoo that demonstrate =sc^Raha^sc=  is scalable and can effectively solve the problem. We use =sc^Raha^sc=  to propose capacity augments that allow operators to mitigate potential problems and avoid future outages. Our results show =sc^Raha^sc=  can find $\ge 2\times$ higher degradations compared to those tools that only consider up to $2$ failures.
