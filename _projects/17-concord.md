#### Abstract

Misconfiguration is frequently cited as a leading cause of service disruptions and outages. To prevent misconfiguration, we introduce network _contracts_---lightweight configuration checks that run efficiently, localize errors to specific lines, and require no heavyweight modeling of network protocols. We develop a tool =sc^Concord^sc= to learn contracts automatically from example network configurations. By checking these learned contracts against new or changed configurations, =sc^Concord^sc= finds likely configuration bugs before they can impact the network. Key to our approach is a scalable algorithm for learning "relational" contracts that capture complex dependencies between configuration settings. We deployed =sc^Concord^sc= as part of a cloud-based configuration management service and evaluated its scalability, coverage, precision, and utility on two large real-world configuration datasets.
