#### Abstract

Motivated by recent results that show that Internet protocols
can be surprisingly complex and, in particular, that BGP is
Turing complete, we ask the same question for the Domain
Name System (DNS). DNS is at least as pervasive and essential as BGP in the global Internet infrastructure. Besides the
scientific interest, the complexity of DNS can have implications for new applications (that can utilize the unsuspected
power of DNS),
and for verification (to understand basic complexity limits
and suggest new verification algorithms). In this paper, we
show that using the power of $\mathtt{DNAME}$ records, DNS can express regular languages and pushdown systems. The first result can be used to build a system
for controlling domain access (of which parental control is
a special case). The second result shows that verification of
DNS zone files is likely to take time that is at least cubic in
the number of records.
