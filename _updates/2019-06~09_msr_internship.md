I am interning with [Ryan Beckett] from the [MNR ] group led by [Victor Bahl]. I am developing the first verification tool using static analysis for _proactive_ and _exhaustive_ checking of the DNS configurations (zone files) for common bugs. I am also working with [Karthick Jayaraman] on finding misconfigurations in Microsoft data center and WAN router configurations and aiming to submit the work to NSDI 2020 fall deadline.
