I am serving on the artifact evaluation committee of the [SIGCOMM 2021] conference. 
Artifact evaluation ensures that the results claimed in research papers are efficiently and accurately reproducible, facilitating further research. This is only the second year since SIGCOMM started artifact evaluation, so consider submitting the supporting artifacts for your research papers.
