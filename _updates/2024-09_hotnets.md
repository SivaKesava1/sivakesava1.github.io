We have two exciting papers accepted at [HotNets 2024]! The first paper, led by our student Pooria Namyar, explores the performance analysis of learning-enabled systems, for example, DNNs in cloud systems. The second paper, led by students Pantea Karimi and Solal Pirelli introduces $\mathcal{X}$plain, a tool that helps operators understand when and why their heuristics underperform.
