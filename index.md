<div class="bio" markdown="1">
I am a third year PhD student, in the [CS department][CS@UCLA] at [UCLA], where I am fortunate to be advised by two amazing people, [Prof. Todd Millstein][Todd Millstein] and [Prof. George Varghese][George Varghese]. My research interests lie at the intersection of Networks and Programming Languages. My work is focused on addressing two key limitations in the current network verification technology - the lack of formal specifications, and a shallow application that is limited only to the routing layer.

My research seeks to make it easier for operators to design, build, and maintain reliable distributed networks

My projects in network verification have been in colloboration with [Ryan Beckett] and [Behnaz Arzani] from [MNR ] group at [Microsoft Research] and [Karthick Jayaraman] from Windows Azure security group at Microsoft.

Before [UCLA] happened, I  was an undergraduate student in the [CSE department][CS@IITKGP] at [IIT Kharagpur] where I was advised by [Prof. Sandip Chakraborty][Sandip Chakraborty] for my undergraduate thesis.
